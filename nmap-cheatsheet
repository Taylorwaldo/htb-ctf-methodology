# Common Nmap Flags Cheat Sheet

Here’s a quick rundown of commonly used `nmap` flags with descriptions.

---

### **Scan Types**
- `-sS` → **TCP SYN scan**  
  Sends a SYN packet to see if a port is open without completing the TCP handshake (stealthy scan).

- `-sT` → **TCP connect scan**  
  Completes the full TCP handshake to check if a port is open (less stealthy).

- `-sU` → **UDP scan**  
  Scans UDP ports to check which services are running.

- `-sV` → **Service/version detection**  
  Detects what service is running on a port and its version (e.g., Apache 2.4).

- `-O` → **OS detection**  
  Attempts to determine the target’s operating system based on TCP/IP stack fingerprinting.

- `-sC` → **Default script scan**  
  Runs Nmap’s default NSE scripts to check for common vulnerabilities and information.

---

### **Ports**
- `-p <port>` → **Scan specific port(s)**  
  Example: `-p 22,80,443` scans SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS.

- `-p-` → **Scan all ports**  
  Scans all 65535 TCP ports.

---

### **Host Discovery / Ping Options**
- `-Pn` → **Treat host as online**  
  Skip ping checks; useful if ICMP is blocked.

- `-PS` → **TCP SYN ping**  
  Checks if host is up using a SYN packet.

- `-PA` → **TCP ACK ping**  
  Checks host status with an ACK packet.

- `-PE` → **ICMP echo ping**  
  Standard ping request to check if host is alive.

---

### **Output / Verbosity**
- `-v` → **Verbose**  
  Shows more details while scanning.

- `-vv` → **Extra verbose**  
  Even more detailed output.

- `-oN <file>` → **Normal output to a file**  
  Saves scan results in normal text format.

- `-oX <file>` → **XML output**  
  Saves results in XML format for automation or parsing.

- `-oG <file>` → **Grepable output**  
  Easy to parse with scripts or `grep`.

- `-oA <basename>` → **Output in all formats**  
  Saves normal, XML, and grepable outputs with the same basename.

---

### **Other Useful Flags**
- `--script <script>` → **Run specific NSE scripts**  
  Example: `--script smb-enum-shares` to enumerate SMB shares.

- `--top-ports <n>` → **Scan the top N common ports**  
  Faster than scanning all ports.

- `--reason` → **Show why a port is reported open/closed**  
  Useful for understanding Nmap’s output.

- `--open` → **Only show open ports**  
  Filters out closed/filtered ports in the output.
